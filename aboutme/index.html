    <p>I'm studying programming, I really like playing video games with my friends, I also like reading books, watching movies and series, I like going on adventures like playing sports and climbing mountains. I'm single, I don't have children, I'm currently working as a salesman but I want to change jobs and I really like BYU because the platform is dynamic. I have been a member of the church since 2010 and I am very happy to be here studying with you.</p>
